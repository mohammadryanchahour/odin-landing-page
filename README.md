Hi Guys. This is my second Project here on Odin Project. 
In this Project, I'll be using HTML and CSS fundamentals that I've learned so far in the Foundations course of The Odin Project to create a Landing Page for a website.
So, I will be using HTML concepts and CSS basics with Flexbox fundamentals.
I hope I do well. So, Wish me Luck!
